This is a project related to a Udacity course: JavaScript Design Patterns.

It displays an interactive map of landmarks in Los Angeles using Knockout.js and jQuery and uses data from the Google Maps and Wikipedia API's.

To run, clone the repository or unzip all files to a local directory. Open up index.html with a browser.

I included a gulp script to minify main.js.
